# archivist
The goal of the project Archivist is to provide an easy-to-use digital repository for musical societies and brass bands.
Therefore, an archivist can manage a repository of musical pieces and store the corresponding musical scores.
This approach also allows you to have a simple overview of musical pieces, search for them and as a result print them out easily.
